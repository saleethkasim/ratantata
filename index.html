                    <p>Ratan Tata, in full Ratan Naval Tata, (born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), Indian businessman who became chairman (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate.

                        A member of a prominent family of Indian industrialists and philanthropists (see Tata family), he was educated at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, where he earned a B.S. (1962) in architecture before returning to work in India. He gained experience in a number of Tata Group businesses and was named director in charge (1971) of one of them, the National Radio and Electronics Co. He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in 1991 succeeded his uncle, J.R.D. Tata, as chairman of the Tata Group.</p>
                    <p>Upon assuming leadership of the conglomerate, Tata aggressively sought to expand it, and increasingly he focused on globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired London-based Tetley Tea for $431.3 million, and in 2004 it purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of South Korea’s Daewoo Motors for $102 million. In 2007 Tata Steel completed the biggest corporate takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant Anglo-Dutch steel manufacturer Corus Group for $11.3 billion.

                        In 2008 Tata oversaw Tata Motors’ purchase of the elite British car brands Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company. The $2.3 billion deal marked the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian automotive firm.</p>

                    <h2>Ratan Tata – Entrepreneurial Journey</h2>
                       <p><b> 1. Early Life</b>
                        Ratan Naval Tata is an Indian businessman and chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons. He was born in a famous and a prominent family, belonging to Mumbai’s wealthy Parsi community on 28 December 1937. His childhood was troubled as his parents separated in the mid-1940s. He was seven years old at that time.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>2.Educational Background</b>
                        Later, he completed his BSc degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962 and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>3. Raising Of A Great Business Tycoon</b>
                        He joined the Tata Group in December 1962, after turning down a job with IBM as per the advice of JRD Tata. He was first sent to Jamshedpur to work at Tata Steel. He worked on the floor along with other blue-collar employees, shoveling limestone and handling the blast furnaces.
                        
                        During the course of time, Ratan Tata proved to be instrumental in ushering in a wide array of reforms. It was under his stewardship that Tata Consultancy Services went public and Tata Motors was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1971 Ratan was appointed the Director-in-Charge of The National Radio & Electronics Company Limited (Nelco).
                        
                        At that time Nelco had a 2% market share in the consumer electronics market and a loss margin of 40% of sales when Ratan took over. With his handwork and perseverance, Nelco eventually grew to have a market share of 20% and recovered its losses in 1975.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><b>4. Man Of Ethics</b>
                        According to Gopalakrishnan “Tata has shown that there is no other way he will do business other than do it ethically”. He points to the Tata Finance episode (financial irregularities by senior company officials had led to the loss of a few hundred crores) as an example. At that time, when the loss was yet to be ascertained (estimates ranged from Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore).</p>
                        
                        
                        
                       <p><b>5. True Leader</b>
                        As a leader he is bold and a man of ideas. Ratan Tata’s leadership quality was displayed in identifying the need to go global very early on. His wisdom in waiting to make the group more competitive before going in for the international push, his skill as a leader in making this theme resonate all over the group, the aggression with which he has won some of these cross-border deals, and his unshakable resolve never to compromise on the ethics and values that the group has cherished for over hundred years now.</p>
